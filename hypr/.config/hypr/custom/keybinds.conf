# This file is generated by `~/.config/hypr/hyprland/scripts/generate_keybinds.sh`.
# It concatenates `custom/keybinds.common.conf` and a per-quickshell file
# `custom/keybinds.$QS.conf` (if present) into this file so only the
# relevant quickshell keybinds are active.
# If you want to edit keybinds permanently, edit either:
#  - `custom/keybinds.common.conf` (shared binds)
#  - `custom/keybinds.<name>.conf` (per-qs binds)
# and then run the generator script or restart Hyprland.

## Fallback: use common-only so the configuration remains usable until
## the generator runs on startup.
